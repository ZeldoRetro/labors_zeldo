You managed to finish
this first Wave of

Other Waves are of course planned,

My future project Zelda Another

continues as well for
a release in 2030 !
I hope you enjoyed
exploring my various Labors
on Tower of the Triforce...

waiting for Link...
Maybe he'll come one day,
unexpectedly...
Who knows what the Future holds...
I also invite you to leave from here
for now. When I have other Labors
to offer, you will of course be
invited. Let me offer you
this credit as a reward.
See you later !

Welcome to you Visitor !
Welcome to this somewhat crazy
project: The Labors of Zeldo !
The concept is quite simple:
in my long career as
a Creator, I've made many
things. Unfinished projects,
copies of existing projects,
or just simple tests.
The concept of The Labors of
Zeldo is to offer you
to explore these various Labors,
updated and reworked to be
perfectly playable.
Which brings us to the present
situation. Here you are in front
of me, you, Player of this
crazy project.
I created this magical place
especially to house
my Labors.
Each floor of this Manor
represents a Wave of
content.
You're on the 2nd Floor, which is
therefore about Zelda Tower of the
Triforce, a project from 2017.
As this is the very first floor
of the Manor you're exploring,
let me explain the
functioning of the place to you...
Follow me please. I don't have
much time.

Welcome to the 1st Wave
as such. I hope
you like the music and decor.
They come directly from Tower
of the Triforce.
Hold on, let me explain !
You are currently in the HUB
of the floor. It is always modeled
according to the current Wave.
(Here for example it's the Casino
of Hyrule, an additional Dungeon
planned in Zelda TotT).
From here, you can access
the various Labors I have to offer
and the Galleries.
The right part is dedicated to
the Labors as such. Explore
the various available portals.
Behind each portal is
a painting. Don't hesitate to
consult it for information.
Each portal represents a
Labor Zone. Each Zone
has a Trophy.
By collecting Trophies, new
portals will appear,
and so on until you obtain
the Gold Key, which will allow you
to open the door behind me.
Once through this door, you will
have completed the Wave of
content. Of course, there are
various collectibles to gather.
But I'll let you discover all of
that... why not try for
a 100% ? Good luck anyway...
There's also a Shop. You'll find
various bonuses to help you
in the Labor Zones.
The left part contains
the Development Galleries.
It's basically Bonus content.
However, you'll need to collect
various colored Keys to
access the various sections.
Each Room contains a
different content. I hope
you'll have fun visiting them.
That's all for the explanations.
Congratulations for not falling
asleep while reading them.

      - Dungeon Design 1 -

Are you curious to see
how a Dungeon is
designed in Zeldo's mind ?
Since he'll never finish his
tutorial on the subject, here's a
quick guide in 2 steps...
The first step is to imagine
the Dungeon Graph.
This is what this table illustrates...
It's basically the skeleton of the
Dungeon. It represents the path
to take, the various obstacles etc.
Here's the Graph of the beloved
Water Temple. Don't understand
anything ? That's normal.

      - Dungeon Design 2 -

Are you curious to see
how a Dungeon is 
designed in Zeldo's mind ?
Since he'll never finish his
tutorial on the subject, here's the
continuation of the quick guide.
The second step is simply to
transpose the Graph onto a Map.
Thus, we imagine the rooms and
we stage the various obstacles
imagined at the beginning.

This Map is generally more
understandable than the Graph
for non-initiates...
We notice here that Zeldo is
so talented that he didn't even
need to finish his Map.
He already knew the design of the
rest of the Dungeon by heart !
He's really amazing, isn't he ?
(You tell me if I'm overdoing it...)


The last logical step is to
transpose the Map thus made
onto your creation software...
It's probably the longest, but
also the most fun ! Come on Max,
make me a beautiful Dungeon !

the Dungeons.
Villages are also
a place where it's easy to
find Rupees.
You can even find Rupees
that respawn endlessly

Finally, it's worth knowing that
Lord Zeldo is a little rascal...

He actually hid
a Silver Rupee in each
of his Labor Zones,
except in the Temples of
Fire and Water, as those
contain secret rooms.
These are, however, very
well hidden behind

in each Zone:

- Abuda Archipelago: 15
- Temple of Fire: 8
- Hylia Falls: 15
- Temple of Water: 25
- Frozen Cave: 5
- Ancient Catacomb: 32
Shards (1) are generally
in chests and Stones (5)
are in hidden places.
Gems (10) and Crystals
(25) are left by the
Bosses present in the Zones.
It's then worth knowing that
as usual in
Zeldo's Creations,
there's a secret room in
each presented Dungeon
(Water, Fire, and Tomb).
These are not on
the Map but can be deduced
based on the Dungeon's pattern.
You now have all the keys to find
these precious Shards.

Chapter 1: Basic Controls

Here's the list of possible commands
to use in the game:

- Action (Space) allows various
interactions (talk, run,
carry, swim, ...).
- Roll (Space) allows you to do
a roll, which allows you
to move quickly.
- Attack (C) allows you to attack
with the sword. By holding the
button, you can charge
your sword. You can then
tap walls or perform a
circular attack by releasing.
- Item 1/2 (X/V) allows you to
use an item assigned
to one of these keys.
- Pause (D) allows you to put the
game on pause and navigate between
various menus.
- Save (Escape) allows you to
save the game. You
can then choose to
continue your game or not.
Don't forget that every adventurer
must rest regularly!
- Look around (S) allows you to
look beyond the limits
of the camera by moving it.

Inventory
By pressing Pause, you
will open by default the
Inventory menu.
This menu contains assignable items.
You can move your cursor to these
items and decide to use them
by assigning them to Item 1/2.

Some items such as bags
will open. You can then
view their contents and
assign the items containing
them to use or show them

Chapter 3: Other pause menus
The Inventory is not the only
pause menu. By going to
the extreme left/right with
your cursor, you can
switch to other menus.

Know that there are also
shortcut keys for some
menus:
- A will open the Map menu.
- Q will open the Commands menu.
These keys can be modified.
The Quest Status menu contains
various information regarding
your quest progression.
It includes quest items.
They usually indicate your
progression in various
main or side quests.

You can also consult
statistics related to the
game: Your playtime,
your attack/defense, and your
number of deaths.

The Map menu will show the
world map and your position if
you're in the outside world.
If you're in a Dungeon, it
will show you the area map and
the Dungeon's stats.
Another menu is the Commands
menu. It will allow you
to modify the keys used
and even to play with a controller
(see chapter 5 for more
details).

and the possible actions
to perform if you press Action.

In the bottom left is listed
the current number of Rupees
and the number of small keys if
you're in a Dungeon or an area containing small keys.
In the bottom right is the
clock. This indicates the
current Time cycle.

commands and controller support
The detail of the commands is found
in the Commands menu.

We won't repeat them here

possible to modify them.
To do so, press Action
on the desired command and
press the new key.
Good news for gamepad enthusiasts: It's possible to
play with a controller!
To assign an action to a
controller button, the method is
the same as mentioned earlier.
However, it's important to
note that any key customization
is saved
with each game file
only. If you start a
new game, you'll need to
assign your keyboard/controller

Chapter 7: Day/night cycle

In the world, Time passes
only in the outside world
and outside of villages.
Just stay long enough
in the same area until you hear
a sound effect.
This means that time has passed
one cycle.

In the next zone change,
Time will be in the next
cycle.

Time is divided into 6 cycles:
2 for day, 1 for evening,
2 for night, 1 for dawn.
It's advisable to visit
areas and especially
villages during day and night.
Depending on the time of day,
various events can occur.
Additional note: Sleeping in
a bed will immediately
advance to the next
day/night cycle.

It seems I've

I'll let you live,

You'll soon understand

We will meet again!
Take what remains of
Din's Pearl... I offer it to you!

Hehehe... as Master Ganondorf predicted. 

I suppose you've come
for Din's Pearl?

I regret to inform you that it
is no longer here! Not entirely
at least... hehehe...
My name is Vire and I have come
here on my Master's orders for 2 things...
The first: To ensure that a
young blond boy could not find
Din's Pearl.
The second: To get rid of
this young boy!

So I have only one
thing left to do...
En garde!
